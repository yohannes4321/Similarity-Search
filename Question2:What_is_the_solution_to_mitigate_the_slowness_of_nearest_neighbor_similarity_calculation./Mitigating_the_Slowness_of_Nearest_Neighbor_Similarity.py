why Nearset neighbor similarity is slow

arrises from the neeed to compute the distance between a query point 
and every other point in data set .

the compitotional cost become very slow as data set grows

main reason for slowness
1 high dimensional spaces 

    Euclidean lose meaning as distance between meaning is less meaningfull.
    increased computional cost with out meaningfull result 
2 Large Data set Size
    compute distance for all points requires O(N) operation per query
    for M queries O(M.N) which is inefficient for large data set 
3 Brute force search 
all pairwise distance calculated and sorted and k nearset neighbours are selected 


Techinques to Speed Up Nearest Neighbor Search


1 Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)

avoid exhaustive pairwaise comparisons by stratigically  indexing the data 
and making approximations

exact accuracy for massive performance gains for achieving result close 


Principles
  1 data partitioning :Divide the dataset into smaller and more mangeable chunks
2 Efficent Indexing use tree based ,hash based and graph based structures to quickly identify
approximate neighbors
3 Approximation Allow a small margin of error to speed up the competations

B Vector Quantization

vector quantization is a technique used to compress high dimiensional vectors into smaller repersentaion 

whicn makes faster and less memory 

high-dimensional  data is mapped to smaller set or representative data
instead of comparing the query to every vector in the data set comparsions are
made to smaller set of centroid
