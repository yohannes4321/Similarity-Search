 Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points 
 in a multi-dimensional space. The Euclidean Distance Search is a method used to find the 
 nearest points (or vectors) to a given point based on their Euclidean distances.
Step 1: Find the difference between the corresponding elements in the two vectors:


d(p,q)=‚àö(x(p)-x(q))2+(y(p)-y(q))2+(z(p)-z(q))2
 Vector Representation:

Data points (e.g., documents, user preferences, etc.) are represented as vectors in an 
ùëõ
n-dimensional space.
For example, if you are comparing user profiles based on age, income, and spending score, each user profile is represented as a vector of three numbers.
Query Point:

A search query is treated as another vector.
The objective is to find the data points (vectors) that are "nearest" to this query vector in terms of Euclidean distance.
Calculating Distance:

The Euclidean distance is computed between the query vector and each data point.
The distances indicate how "close" or "similar" each data point is to the query. A smaller distance implies a higher similarity.
Returning Nearest Neighbors:

Once distances are calculated, data points are ranked based on their distances from the query.
The nearest points (i.e., with the smallest distances) are returned as the search results.
